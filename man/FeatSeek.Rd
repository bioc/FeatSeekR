\usage{
FeatSeek(
  data,
  replicates = NULL,
  max_features = NULL,
  init = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{SummarizedExperiment with assay named data, where each sample
belongs to a different replicate. Which sample belongs to which replicate
should indicated in colData slot replicates. Or matrix with features x samples.}

\item{replicates}{numeric vector of length samples,
indicating which sample belongs to which replicate. Only required if data is
provided as matrix.}

\item{max_features}{integer number of features to rank}

\item{init}{vector with names of initial features.
If NULL the feature with highest F-statistic will be used}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether messages should be printed}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment containing one assay with the selected features.
rowData stores for each selected feature the F-statistic under metric,
the cumulative explained variance under explained_variance and
the feature names under selectedÂ´
}
\description{
This function ranks features of a 2
dimensional array according to their reproducibility between replicates.
}
\examples{
# run FeatSeek to select the top 20 features
data <-  array(rnorm(100*30), dim=c(30,100),
dimnames <- list(paste("feature", seq_len(30)), NULL))
reps <- rep(c(1,2), each=50)
res <- FeatSeek(data, reps, max_features=20)

# res stores the 20 selected features ranked by their replicate reproducibility
