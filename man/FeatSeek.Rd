\usage{
FeatSeek(data, preselected, max_features, filter_thr = 0.5, stop_thr = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{3 dimensional array with samples $\times$ replicates x features.}

\item{preselected}{vector with names of preselected features.}

\item{max_features}{integer number of features to rank}

\item{filter_thr}{float between 0 and 1. Features with correlation < filter_thr are removed .}

\item{stop_thr}{float between 0 and 1. Stops feature selection if ratio of positive correlations of remaining features is <= stop_thr}
}
\value{
Dataframe with selected features, rmsd, 1/VIF and variance explained for the selection process
}
\description{
This function ranks features of a 3 dimensional array according to their consistency between replicates.
After the ranking procedure the optimal subset of features is determined by maximizing the inverse of the variance inflation factor (VIF)
and the fraction of variance of the remaining features that can be explained by the selected ones. The VIF is a measure for collinearity
in linear regression, the higher the inverse of VIF the lower the redundancy.
