\title{FeatSeekR an R package for unsupervised feature selection}
\description{
FeatSeekR performs unsupervised feature selection using replicated 
measurements. It iteratively selects features with the highest 
reproducibility across replicates, after projecting out those dimensions 
from the data that are spanned by the previously selected features. The 
selected a set of features has a high replicate reproducibility and a high 
degree of uniqueness.
